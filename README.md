• Reference signal tracking via K-MPC, where non-linear system dynamics (from Burgers' PDE) are converted to Linear one using only the snapshot dataset leveraging Koopman Operator Theory. MPC is built on top of the linear dynamics obtained.

• This project provides python programming language flexibilty to original code written in matlab.

• Data driven approach used - Arbabi, H., Korda, M. and Mezic, I. [2018], ‘A data-driven koopman model predictive control framework for nonlinear flows’.
